# The Beckmann Rearrangement:

## Introduction

The Beckmann rearrangement named after German Ernst Otto Beckmann is a classic acid-mediated transformation converting oxime into amides. The reaction has significant industrial importance whether in the production of Nylon-6 or the synethesis of paracetamol drug (Hoechst-Celanese).

The reaction provides a key example in the class of **rearrangement reaction involving intramolecular migration with stereochemical control**.

## Reaction Mechanism

The reaction proceds by protonation of the -OH of oxime via an acid (protic or Lewis acids are in use). The water moleculue leaves and simultanaouesly the alkyl group
anti to -H2O+ migrates forming the nitrilium ion which then undergoes solvolysis (although can be attacked by another nucleophile) followed by tautomerization.

## Competitive Reaction: The Beckmann Fragmentation

Before I explain to you the Beckmann Fragmentation I'll let you give a thought, the hint is crossover products are formed when 2 substrates are present.

If the migrating group can exist as a stable carbocation intermediate there is an increased probability of the migrating group not migrating (intra), then where does it land up?

As seen above, it cleaves as a stabilized carbocation open to attack by other nucleophiles in situ.

The following example is where the carbocation intermediate is stabilized via backbonding form the Oxygen atom.

## The Semmler-Wolff Reaction and Related NGP Effects

The following example can be thought similar to a neighbouring group participation of Sulphur which is involved in stabilizing the transition state.

I have further added an interesting aromatization reaction called the Semmler-Wolff Reaction forming aniline from the oxime of cyclohexenone.
